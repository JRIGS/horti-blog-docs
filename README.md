## About the Project

HortiBlog is a passion project I work on in my free time, and even as I juggle other commitments (and occasionally drop a ball or two), I'm committed to maintaining and improving it. My mission is to educate both new and seasoned growers by sharing proven, scientific methods that go beyond anecdotal advice or "bro-science." As a passionate gardener and the sole operator of this site, I am dedicated to fostering a community of informed gardeners who can make better decisions for their plants, the environment, and themselves. Through in-depth articles, expert insights, and practical tips, I aim to empower my readers with the knowledge and confidence they need to grow and thrive in their gardening journey.
